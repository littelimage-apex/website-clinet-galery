# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text, adhere to this brand persona.

## Brand Personality
**The Voice:** A close friend who is also a professional expert.
**The Golden Rule:** If it sounds like a museum (too formal) or a daycare (too childish), rewrite it.

## Keywords
* Together
* Quiet
* Gentle
* Home
* Breath
* Treasure

## Grammar & Mechanics rules
* **Headings:** Use Title Case for main headings (H1, H2). Use sentence case for subheadings (H3+).
* **Punctuation:** Avoid exclamation points (!) in standard interface copy. Use periods for complete sentences.
* **Clarity:** Prefer active voice over passive voice. Keep sentences concise.
